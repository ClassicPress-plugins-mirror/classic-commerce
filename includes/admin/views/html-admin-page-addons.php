		<h1>Extensions for Classic Commerce</h1>

		<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Although Classic Commerce is a fork of WooCommerce version 3.5.3, all JetPack and WooCommerce Services integration has been removed.</p>

		<p>Many extensions or plugins designed for WooCommerce will still work with Classic Commerce provided they do not rely on Jetpack or WooCommerce Services.</p>

		<p><strong>The end user is entirely responsible for choosing, installing, testing and monitoring any extensions or plugins that are needed to provide extra functionality to the Classic Commerce core.</strong></p>

		<p>Before installing and using any extensions or plugins we strongly recommend that you first work in a test environment. If you are working on a live site please ensure that you have a recent backup.</p>

		<p>For discussion and help with finding compatible Classic Commerce addons, use the <a href="https://forums.classicpress.net/c/support/classic-commerce/">ClassicPress community forum</a>. For problems with the Classic Commerce core files please raise an issue via <a href="https://github.com/ClassicPress-research/classic-commerce/issues/">Github issues</a>.</p>
